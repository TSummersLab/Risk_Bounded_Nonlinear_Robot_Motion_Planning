# Running Monte-Carlo Simulations

1. Create a new folder called "monte_carlo_results" in the same directory
1. Update the trial number in line #1554 in the file "monte_carlo_car.py" and run it while the Carla executable is open
1. After the simulation is over, automatically the results are stored under the folder "monte_carlo_results" with a specific trial name
1. Repeat the process by changing trial number in step 2 and run again.
1. Once the all trials are completed, run the python file "monte_carlo_results_plotter.py" to plot the monte-carlo simulation results
